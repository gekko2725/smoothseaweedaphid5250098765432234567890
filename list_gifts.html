1. The Great Swindle (Au revoir là-haut) by Pierre Lemaitre (2013, trans. Frank Wynne)
Post-WWI masterpiece—two traumatized soldiers (one a clever schemer) pull off an elaborate, audacious con against the corrupt system. Sympathetic anti-heroes with heart, wit, and revenge. Prix Goncourt winner. Pure gentleman-thief energy.
2. Arsène Lupin, Gentleman-Thief by Maurice Leblanc (various collections, modern English editions)
The original French icon: charming, brilliant con man and thief who robs the rich, helps the innocent, and outsmarts everyone. Timeless, fun, and the blueprint for every likable rogue since.
3. How’s the Pain? by Pascal Garnier (2006, trans. Emily Boyce)
An aging hitman (sympathetic, world-weary criminal) on his last job, with black humor and unexpected tenderness. Garnier’s dark, quirky French noir often features flawed, oddly endearing crooks.
4. Fatale by Jean-Patrick Manchette (1977, but modern translations renewed interest; trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith)
A seductive, cunning female assassin/con artist on a revenge heist. Manchette’s neo-noir classics feature sharp, morally complex criminals who feel almost heroic in their rebellion.
5. The Prone Gunman (La Position du tireur couché) by Jean-Patrick Manchette (1981, trans. James Brook)
A weary hitman trying to retire—cold but human, with that reluctant charm. French noir at its best: anti-hero criminal with depth.
6. Three to Kill by Jean-Patrick Manchette (1976, trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith)
Ordinary man drawn into crime world, but the vibe echoes sympathetic crooks caught in the system. Gritty, fast, and full of elegant criminals.
7. Alex (and the Verhoeven trilogy) by Pierre Lemaitre (2011+, trans. Frank Wynne)
While detective-led, the criminals and robbers often have twisted sympathy—gangs with codes, clever schemes. Lemaitre’s style keeps the anti-heroes compelling.
8. The Three Evangelists trilogy by Fred Vargas (2006+, trans. Sian Reynolds)
Quirky, eccentric investigators (including a disgraced cop), but the cases involve odd, sympathetic outsiders/criminals in a whimsical French way.
9. Nymphéas Noirs (Black Water Lilies) by Michel Bussi (2011, trans. available)
Modern French thriller with clever twists and a con-like puzzle—characters with hidden depths and moral ambiguity.
10. The Thief by George Darien (1897 rediscovered, new 2026 English trans. by Jacques Houis)
Recently translated—young man cheated out of inheritance turns to crime. Classic sympathetic criminal origin story, fresh in modern eyes
