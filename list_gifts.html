me: Vagden Merino wool socks
Rolex Explorer II 42mm black dial (ref. 226570): Subtle power, orange GMT hand for your split life, brushed steel — stretch goal, ~$12,000 CAD, worn for piano nights and leash tugs.
• Furlan Marri Mechaquartz Black Sector (ref. 2116-A): Microbrand driver, black PVD, mechaquartz chrono, ~$600 CAD — minimal, stealth, cut for your wrists when you roll sleeves or grip my hips.
• Luca Faloni white linen band collar shirt with French cuffs: Soft, breathable linen, mother-of-pearl buttons, ~$250 CAD — top two undone for daylight teases, cufflinks engraved with my initials inside.
• Tanner Goods belt, matte black, full-grain leather: Wide loops for my fingers, no buckle flash, ~$150 CAD — easy to grab, use as leash, tear off with my teeth.
• Le Labo Santal 33 cologne: Smoke, wood, salt, ~$300 CAD — layered with your Acqua di Giò on pulse points, my lips on your neck tasting it after you play.
• Quartz Co. Clark Parka, charcoal: Synthetic insulation, no fur/down, mid-thigh cut, ~$800 CAD — cut for Maverick walks, unzipped slow in the hallway.
• A.P.C. New Standard Straight pants, raw selvedge denim, mid-blue: 12.5 oz Japanese cotton, mid-rise, straight leg, ~$250 CAD — breaks in like your will, cut to roll or tuck.
• Common Projects Achilles Low sneakers, matte white leather: Minimal rubber sole, squared toe, ~$500 CAD — no socks, bare ankles for my lips, worn with everything.
