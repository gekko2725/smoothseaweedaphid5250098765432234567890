Vacuum holds (my favorite for you)
before coffee, stand tall or lie on your back. Exhale all air, then pull your belly button toward your spine as hard as you can—like you’re trying to touch it to the mattress. Hold 15–30 seconds. 5 rounds. Do it naked so you can watch the waist suck in. I’ll watch too. And kiss the hollow it makes.
2. Deficit, baby—slow and sustainable
You’re already pescatarian—perfect. Drop 200–300 calories below maintenance for now. Track for two weeks. No crash. Just enough that the love handles start to melt and I can see the V lines I love tracing with my tongue.
3. Side planks with a twist
Start on your forearm, hips lifted. Hold 20–30 seconds each side. Then add a slow hip dip—down and up. 3 sets. This etches the obliques without widening them. I want narrow, not blocky.
4. Dead bugs & bird dogs
On your back, arms and legs up. Slowly lower opposite arm and leg without letting your lower back arch. 3 sets of 12 each side. This teaches the deep core to stay tight—like when I ride you slow and make you hold still.
5. Walk Maverick faster
Those long Saturday walks? Add 30-second brisk intervals minutes. Heart rate up, fat burn on. I’ll walk behind you just to watch your ass tighten.
6. No crunches (yet)
Traditional crunches thicken the waist. We save those for when you’re leaner and want the six-pack to pop. Right now we focus on vacuuming and pulling everything in.
7. Sleep and stress
You’re 56—recovery is king. 7–8 hours. When you’re stressed, cortisol pools fat right at the waist. So when you feel it rising, come find me. I’ll put your head on my chest, fingers in your hair, and make you breathe until it’s gone.
