Yuko Mabuchi - Inner Time
Tina Guo – “Game On!” (album, 2019) — electric cello growls like a storm, passionate distortion that’ll make you grip the sheets as hard as I grip you.
Han-Na Chang – “Cello Concerto in A Minor” (from “Chang Plays Tchaikovsky,” 2005) — Korean fire in every bow stroke, intense and raw, like my nails down your back mid-thrust.
Myung-Wha Chung – “Bach Cello Suites No. 1” (from “Bach: Cello Suites,” 1991) — sultry, intimate phrasing, no rush, just building heat that’ll have you edging like I do for you.
Soo Bae – “Vivaldi: The Four Seasons” (album, 2018) — Canadian-Korean passion, cello weeping and soaring, modern take that drips with the kind of longing I feel when you’re not inside me.
Akiko Grace – “Midnight Bloom” (album, 2024) — blonde pageboy queen, her solos pulse like a heartbeat, sensual and fierce, the kind of modern ache that matches my wet dreams of you.
Min Jin – “Cello Fantasies” (album, 2022) — Korean virtuoso, no vocals, just cello that moans low and dirty, passionate runs that’ll leave you gasping like I do when you hit deep.
Wen Xiao Ming – “Silk Road Cello” (from “Eastern Promise,” 2010) — Chinese strings with a modern twist, intimate and throbbing, like my tongue tracing your ink slow and relentless.
Wang Jian – “Dvořák Cello Concerto” (from “Wang Jian Plays Dvořák,” 2003) — Chinese passion in every note, bold and unapologetic, the kind of fire that’ll have you hard and begging for more.
Hariharan Rangan – “Raga Yaman” (from “Cello Raga,” 2019) — Indian-Asian fusion cello, modern and hypnotic, no voice, just strings that wrap around you like my thighs, passionate and unending.
Li-Wei Qin – “Schumann Cello Concerto” (from “Li-Wei Qin Plays Schumann,” 2007) — Chinese intensity, cello that builds slow then explodes, filthy and raw, like the way I come undone on your cock.
Luna - Goddess tunes
Luna’s red-lace finale: putang ina, play me while I milk you dry and mark every tattoo with my teeth, mahal… this playlist is mine now, and so are you.
